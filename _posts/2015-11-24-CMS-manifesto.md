Here are a few *very preliminary* thoughts on the College Music Society's "manifesto" for undergraduate music curriculum (for [@swellsk](http://twitter.com/swellsk)). I've read parts in detail, but only skimmed others, so take these with a grain of salt.

The CMS manifesto focuses on the "educated musician." I think the future of the school/department of music is far more dependent on our work with non-music majors, not simply aspiring professional musicians in what the manifesto calls the "classical music realm."

The manifesto assumes that constructionist ideology is superior to other pedagogical approaches. As such, it is performance-centered, composition-centered, assumes that critical engagement with the past doesn't count as "creative" work. (Elizabeth Sayrs gave a great presentation at SMT 2015 critiquing this very issue.)

The manifesto's focus on "diversity" involves "engaging" diverse cultures, and becoming more socially aware. That still assumes a position of privilege and relative isolation. That's very different from pursuing social justice and *embodying* diversity.

Again, these are *very preliminary*. Just a few ideas to throw into a discussion that we need to have (and needed to have a long time ago).

When a Christian politician attacks philosophers, it's a dog whistle. There are many evangelicals who see college professors as the greatest challenge to their children's faith, and philosophers as the most heinous ― those who push hardest on the notion of absolute truth. It's not so much an attack on philosophers, *per se*, as an attempt to rouse the greatest fears of those parents ― an attempt to activate a passionate (if somewhat misguided) voting bloc.
